      run: brew install ansible ansible-lint

    - name: Run ansible-lint

      # Verifies playbook syntax

    - name: Run ansible-playbook check mode
      run: ansible-playbook --check setup_macbook.yml
      # Performs a dry run, reporting changes without making them
      # This might fail on some tasks if they absolutely require execution (e.g., shell script checks)
      continue-on-error: true # Allow continuing even if check mode fails on certain tasks

    - name: Run ansible-playbook full execution
      run: ansible-playbook setup_macbook.yml
      # Executes the playbook fully on the runner
      # This is the most comprehensive test but modifies the runner environment
